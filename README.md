# STAT545A Participation Repository

This repository stores the exercises completed during each class meeting of the STAT545A class for the September-October, 2019 session. <br>
The repository contains one folder for each class meeting(cm) (#5-#14) with both the .html and .Rmd file of the completed in- class exercise for that meeting.
One exception is the fold __weeks_1_and_2__ which was created in class and contains the in-class work done during weeks 1 and 2 (inluding the navigating_github.md file and the Rmd_exploration.Rmd file).
